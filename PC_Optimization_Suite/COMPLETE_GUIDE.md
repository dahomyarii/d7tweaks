## <a name="faq"></a>❓ FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

### Q: Is this safe? Will it damage my computer?
**A:** Yes, it's safe. We create system restore points before changes. Everything can be undone with ROLLBACK.bat.

### Q: How much FPS improvement can I expect?
**A:** Typical improvement is 20-50 FPS. Your current 40 FPS should reach 50-70 FPS depending on your GPU.

### Q: Do I need to restart my computer?
**A:** Yes, restart recommended after running optimization. Restart required after updating GPU drivers.

### Q: Can I run the scripts multiple times?
**A:** Yes, it's safe. Running twice won't double the improvement though.

### Q: What if I want to undo the optimizations?
**A:** Run ROLLBACK.bat and everything goes back to normal.

### Q: Will my laptop get too hot?
**A:** Possibly - that's why we include cooling tips. Use external cooling pad if temps exceed 85°C.

### Q: Which is more important: GPU drivers or this optimization?
**A:** GPU drivers are MORE important. That alone gives 5-15 FPS. Do drivers first!

### Q: Why is my FPS the same as before?
**A:** Likely GPU drivers are outdated. Update them immediately. If still no change, GPU may be too weak for that game.

### Q: Can I use this on desktop computers?
**A:** Yes, it works on desktops too. Just skip the cooling advice.

### Q: What about online games like CoD? Will I get banned?
**A:** No, these are Windows optimizations. They don't modify game files. It's perfectly safe.

### Q: Which script is most important?
**A:** In order: GPU drivers update > Graphics Optimizer > Power Plan > System Optimizer

### Q: How long does everything take?
**A:** 30-45 minutes total (10-15 min running scripts + 15-20 min updating GPU drivers + restart time)

### Q: Do I need all scripts or can I run individually?
**A:** You can run individually if testing. But running all gives best results.
